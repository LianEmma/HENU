            <p>
                At Health Nest Uganda (HENU), we recognize that proper sanitation and hygiene practices are fundamental to 
                improving the health and well-being of the elderly. Ensuring clean and hygienic living environments helps prevent diseases,
                 promotes dignity, and enhances the quality of life for older community members. <br> <br>
                  Our comprehensive sanitation and hygiene initiatives are designed to address personal and environmental hygiene,
                 improve waste management systems, and educate communities on the importance of maintaining a clean and healthy environment.

                        To improve sanitation facilities, we work on redesigning and upgrading pit latrines.
                         Our efforts focus on making these facilities more accessible, safe, and hygienic for the elderly,
                         ensuring they can be used with ease and without health risks.

                        We implement community-based waste management systems, including regular waste collection,

                         and safe disposal practices. Our goal is to reduce the accumulation of waste and minimize health hazards.

                         We conduct educational campaigns, community meetings, and training sessions to inform and empower community members.
                          By increasing knowledge and understanding,
                         we aim to foster a culture of cleanliness and hygiene.
