                                While distributing soap, our volunteers also conducted health education sessions on COVID-19 to raise awareness
                                 and promote preventive measures. Each Older Person received two bars of soap, and the very vulnerable ones received

                        spread of the virus. The stories we heard from the refugees highlighted their struggles with issues like rape 
                        and mental breakdowns due to trauma. Providing these essential items and services is crucial to ensure their
