                    COVID-19 and its resultant lockdown. Supported by members of the Lions Club of Entebbe and our community volunteers,
                     the team embarked on a mission of compassion and support.`,

                    to the often-forgotten heroes—the nurses of Entebbe Hospital ART clinic. These dedicated professionals
                    provide Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) services to Older Persons and distribute Antiretroviral (ARV)
                    drugs to our sisters and brothers. Remarkably,

                      and fats, effectively breaking down the virus. Unfortunately, many Older Persons cannot afford a bar of soap,
                       highlighting the importance of our efforts.
                    While distributing soap, our volunteers also conducted health education sessions on COVID-19 to raise awareness
                     and promote preventive measures. Each Older Person received two bars of soap, and the very vulnerable ones received 
                     an additional 5 kilograms of posho.`

            On 29th August 2020, the HENU team reached out and supported 100 refugees from the Democratic 
            Republic of Congo and Eritrea with soap, masks, and water purification tablets. These refugees are 
            settled in Gaba Katoogo in Kampala, a wetland area facing floods. While some may argue against 
            supporting those who settled in a swamp, humanitarian response prioritizes saving lives and preventing 
            worsening conditions before assigning blame. These brothers and sisters are in double vulnerability, 
            facing both displacement and environmental hazards. <br>
            
            In addition to the immediate needs of soap, masks, and water purification tablets, these refugees require 
            further support to improve their living conditions. They are in desperate need of mosquito nets to protect 
            against malaria, hand washing stations to maintain hygiene, and COVID-19 prevention messages to curb the 
            spread of the virus. The stories we heard from the refugees highlighted their struggles with issues like rape 
            and mental breakdowns due to trauma. Providing these essential items and services is crucial to ensure their 
            safety and well-being. <br>
            
            The HENU team continues to work closely with the refugees, listening to their needs and providing as much 
            support as possible. However, more assistance is urgently needed to address their critical needs. The refugees 
            in Gaba Katoogo require a concerted effort from the humanitarian community to alleviate their suffering. 
            Contributions towards mosquito nets, hand washing stations, and other necessities are highly welcome. Together, 
            we can make a significant difference in their lives and help them navigate through these challenging times.

                     Many of these individuals live with chronic health conditions that require regular medical attention. 
                     However, the lack of a dedicated transportation solution has become a pressing issue affecting their overall
                      well-being. Without reliable means of transportation to attend regular check-ups, 
                      older persons are often forced to miss their appointments, resort to local herbs, and only seek 
                      medical attention in emergencies.

                      dignity, and quality of life of older persons. By addressing transportation barriers,
                       we pave the way for a community where every older person can age gracefully,

                     efforts to support older persons and the orphans under their care.
                      Today, older persons inspected the Wisdom Centre and the newly acquired sewing machines, which will offer free
                       training in tailoring to orphans. The Wisdom Centre is designed to be an intergenerational hub,

                        social media platforms, thereby bridging the technological gap between young and older generations.
                       This digital inclusion initiative ensures no one is left behind.
                      In return, older persons will impart traditional skills and knowledge to the youth, such as crafting.

                          The Centre's construction has been made possible through generous donations from friends and members.

                    counterparts in Wamilongo village, Busukuma. This event was organized in collaboration with the Infectious

                     similar successes to those of their colleagues in Entebbe. The gathering served as a platform for 
                     older persons to exchange experiences, ideas,
