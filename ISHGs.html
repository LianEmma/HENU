                Welcome to our Intergenerational Self-Help Groups (ISHGs) page,
                 where we celebrate the strength and unity that come from different generations working together.
          
                Our ISHGs are vibrant communities that foster mutual support, knowledge sharing,
                 and collective action among people of all ages. By combining the wisdom of our elders with the energy and innovation of the younger generation,
                 we create a dynamic environment that promotes active aging, social inclusion, and overall well-being.

                Intergenerational Self-Help Groups (ISHGs)</h1>

            <p>
                At HENU, our <b>Intergenerational Self-Help Groups (ISHGs) </b>are dedicated to combatting loneliness—a significant issue that can be as detrimental to health as smoking—by fostering meaningful connections across generations.
                 We believe that bringing together individuals from different age groups can create a supportive network that enhances well-being and combats isolation.
            </p>

            <p>
               <b> Combatting Loneliness:</b> Loneliness has been shown to have serious health implications, 
                and our ISHGs are designed to address this by building strong, supportive relationships between seniors and younger participants.
                 By creating opportunities for regular interaction and mutual support,
                 we aim to reduce feelings of isolation and improve overall quality of life.
            </p>
            <p>
               <b> Collaborating on the Pictures of Ageing Project:</b> We are excited to be partnering with the International Development Institute 
                (IDI) on the Pictures of Ageing Project in Busukuma. This initiative uses photography to capture and share the diverse experiences of aging,
                 fostering greater understanding and appreciation of seniors' lives. Through this collaboration, we aim to highlight the value
                 of intergenerational connections and the impact they have on reducing loneliness and promoting emotional health.
            </p>
