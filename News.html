                <p class="clamped-text">
                    Last week was a busy week for Health Nest Uganda volunteers as we worked tirelessly
                     to bring smiles to the faces of Older Persons during the challenging times of COVID-19 and its resultant lockdown.
                      Supported by members of the Lions Club of Entebbe and our community volunteers,
                     the team embarked on a mission of compassion and support.</p> <br>

                <p class="clamped-text">

                    On 29th August 2020, the HENU team reached out and supported 100 refugees from the Democratic 
                    Republic of Congo and Eritrea with soap, masks,
                     and water purification tablets. These refugees are settled in Gaba Katoogo in Kampala,
                      a wetland area facing floods. While some may argue against supporting those who settled in a swamp,
                       humanitarian response prioritizes saving lives and preventing worsening conditions before assigning blame.
                        These brothers and sisters are in double vulnerability, facing both displacement and environmental hazards.

                <small>22nd April 2020</small>
                <p class="clamped-text">
                    Entebbe Municipality is home to a growing number of older persons who face significant challenges
                    in accessing healthcare services due to transportation barriers. Many of these individuals live with chronic
                    health conditions that require regular medical attention. However, the lack of a dedicated transportation solution has become 
                    a pressing issue affecting their overall well-being. Without reliable means of transportation to attend regular check-ups,
                    older persons are often forced to miss their appointments, resort to local herbs, and only seek medical attention in emergencies. 
                    This situation contributes to an increased burden on emergency healthcare services</p> <br>
