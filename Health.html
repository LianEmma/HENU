            <h4>Our Approach to Health</h4>
            <p>
                Our approach to health at HENU is holistic and integrative,
                 aiming to bridge the gap between informal and formal health care services.
                  We focus on providing accessible, quality care that addresses the diverse health needs of the elderly.
                   By fostering partnerships and community involvement,
                 we aim to create a sustainable and supportive health care network.

                <div>
                   <h4> Facilitating Access to Health Services:</h4>
                   <p>
                    We work to ensure that elderly individuals have access to necessary health services, including regular check-ups,
                     medication, and specialist consultations. 
                    This includes partnering with local health facilities and mobile clinics to reach those in remote areas.
                    </p>
                </div>
 
                <div>
                   <h4>Home Care Support</h4>
                   <p>
                    Our home care support program provides trained volunteers and paid care assistants to 
                    assist the elderly with daily tasks, medication management, and health monitoring.
                     This personalized care helps maintain their independence and well-being.
                    </p>
                </div>
 
                <div>
                   <h4>Health Education and Awareness</h4>
                   <p>
                    We conduct health education campaigns to inform the elderly and their caregivers about common health issues,
                     preventive measures, and healthy lifestyle choices.
                     Workshops and seminars cover topics such as nutrition, chronic disease management, and mental health.
                    </p>
                </div>
 
                <div>
                   <h4>Mental Health and Emotional Support</h4>
                   <p>
                    Recognizing the importance of mental health, we offer counseling services, support groups, 
                    and recreational activities to address issues such as depression, anxiety, and social isolation. 
                    These services help improve the overall quality of life for the elderly.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div>
                   <h4>Health Screenings and Preventive Care</h4>
                   <p>
                    Regular health screenings and preventive care are essential for early detection and treatment of health issues.
                     We organize screening camps and preventive care sessions to ensure that the elderly receive timely medical attention.
                    </p>

        </div>
            <p>
                Our comprehensive approach to health care for the elderly ensures that they receive the support 
                and services they need to live healthy and fulfilling lives. By integrating personal and environmental
                 hygiene practices, improving sanitation facilities, managing waste effectively, and raising awareness,
                 we create a healthier community for the elderly.
